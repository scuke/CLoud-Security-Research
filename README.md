 Cloud Security
 
  Cloud platforms are being turned to by more and more companies. Cloud networks provide what physical ones can't. There are 
  
different services offered and they have robust security using encryption.

Cloud computing is when an entity deploys servers that are accessed remotely. These servers are accessed on the internet 

giving instant access from anywhere to needed data or a service. One big reason businesses have turned to the cloud is it 

reduced costs. To house large amounts of data physically can be expensive and take up a lot more room. Major companies are a 

service provider that removes the headache that comes with setting up your servers. Cloud services are also a great disaster 

recovery plan, say you're using physical servers and the event occurs on-site that affects them like a breach or a power 

outage, The cloud can be there to keep a service running or have backups for your systems. The storage security the cloud 

offers is valuable. According to Infosec in 2017 Equifax was breached through a running software on their servers, this 

could have been prevented if the use of the cloud was implemented. The cloud maximizes uptime. One of the bigger benefits is

how easy to scale a cloud network is compared to a physical one. 

  Based on a company's needs there are different cloud models they can choose to deploy, whatever suits them best. You have 

SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS. The first one, software as a service (SaaS), is a service maintained and distributed by a vendor. This

eliminates the need for hardware and software to be installed. It's accessible anywhere. SaaS is more for small businesses 

and startups, it's not for larger entities. Next, there is infrastructure as a service (IaaS), this cloud model is a service 

hosted by a provider that gives access to computing, storage, networking, and virtualization. This cloud model offers 

scalability and availability. This is a great option for small or large businesses. Finally, there is a platform as a 

service (PaaS), which is used to deploy and manage apps. PaaS gives you the software and hardware tools needed to deploy an application.
  I mentioned before that the cloud offers better security than in-house storage. This is done through an encryption process
  
that encrypts data in transit, data at rest, and data in use. Data in transit uses something called TLS which stands for transport layer security. It is a protocol that is widely adopted and is expected to be used in cloud infrastructures. It 
  
encrypts data traveling between applications. To further reinforce cloud security the provider implements key strategies, 
  
which can be rotating keys every certain amount of time. Inside the company, they can enforce identity and access 
  
management which denies an escalation of privilege attack.
  
  Cloud technology is a huge advancement for cybersecurity. Cloud infrastructure has so much to offer and proves itself to 
  
be incredibly robust that's why so many companies are turning to cloud. Cloud seemingly has no downside but hackers are

always finding new ways to infiltrate and the use of quantum computing cracks our modern keys. As of right now, these 

threats are minimal.
